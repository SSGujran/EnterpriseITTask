# EnterpriseITTask

In order for DisplayDinner.py to run properly, it needs to be in a folder. The folder must contain the .py file and another folder named templates, within which the HTML file goes. If your IDE doesn't allow for deployment of the Flask application, you can run the script and access the web application at [http://127.0.0.1:5000].

The assumption made for this task is that the main priority is the actual data being displayed, rather than the format or aesthetics. Rather than being something that will be presented to users, I approached the script as if it were for devs to quickly double-check some restaurant info.

Further improvements would be made in terms of the looks of the web application in terms of UI/UX. Additionally, I would try to make the data formatted in a more readable way.
